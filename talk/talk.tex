\frame{
\frametitle{Background}
The Higgs boson is produced in many channels.
\pause
The most common in proton collider experiments is 'gluon gluon Fusion' (ggF)

\end{figure}
\pause
The Higgs decays in a very short period of time in many channels, the most common is 2 bottom quarks, but we investigate the decay into 2 photons (the diphoton channel.)

This has a branching fraction of order of  $10^{-3}$ but is much  easier to detect experimentally.

\frame{
\frametitle{Simulation}

The Higgs events and background events are simulated using PYTHIA. The simulation consists of a text file of the Energy and momentum (4 momentum) of each photon in each event (read collision.) We will use 1 simulation of Higgs events (which still have background in them) and 1 simulation of background events.

\frame{
\frametitle{Filter Methods}

\begin{itemize}
  \item There are ~100 Higgs events to ~100,000,000 background events
  \item We need an effective way to distinguish Higgs events from background events
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Filter Methods}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Transverse momentum filtering
    \item Pseudorapidity filtering
    \item Azimuthal angle filtering
  \end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Optimising our Filters}

To optimise our filters so that we have the best ratio of Higgs events to background events, we need to optimise our filter methods for the highest statistical significance $\Sigma$,

\begin{equation}
\Sigma \equiv \frac{S}{\sqrt{S + B}}
\end{equation}

where $S$ is the number of filtered signal events and $B$ is the number of filtered background events.

We apply the filtering and calculate the significance for a series of different parameters, for example for different transverse momenta cuts, to see what gives us the best statistical significance.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

From graphs like these we can narrow down the ranges of transverse momenta that we filter until we get the highest statistical significance.
