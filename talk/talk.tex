\frametitle{Background}
The Higgs boson is produced in many channels.
\pause
The most common in proton collider experiments is 'gluon gluon Fusion' (ggF)

\pause
The Higgs decays in a very short period of time in many channels, the most common is 2 bottom quarks, but we investigate the decay into 2 photons (the diphoton channel.)

This has a branching fraction of order of  $10^{-3}$ but is much  easier to detect experimentally.

\frame{
\frametitle{Simulation}
The Higgs events and background events are simulated using PYTHIA. The simulation consists of a text file of the Energy and momentum (4 momentum) of each photon in each event (read collision.) We will use 1 simulation of Higgs events (which still have background in them) and 1 simulation of background events.


\pause


We need to filter out all of the combined events so that the statistical significance, $\Sigma$, is as high as possible.
\begin{equation}
\Sigma \equiv \frac{S}{\sqrt{S + B}}
\end{equation}

    
Where $S$ is the number of filtered signal (from the simulation) events and $B$ is the number of filtered background events (also simulated.)

\frame{
\frametitle{Selection cuts}
A number of selection cuts are applied to the events
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item Number cut so that only events with 2 or more photons are counted
\item 2 Transverse momentum, $p_T$, cuts so that 1 photon has a larger $p_T$ than $p_{T1}$ and the other has a $p_T > p_{T2}$
\item 2 Energy $E$ cuts, in a similar principle to the $p_T$ cuts
\item Cuts for the angular difference between the 2 photons derived from the difference in azimuthal angle $\Delta \phi^2$ and the difference in pseudorapidity, $\Delta \eta^2$ 
\end{enumerate}
